Spotify Song Analysis is a fun and insightful project where we dive into a huge collection of over 100,000 Spotify tracks to discover what makes a song tick. Using Python and tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Streamlit, we explore various musical features—like danceability, energy, tempo, and popularity—to better understand music trends and patterns. From finding out which genres are most popular to visualizing how songs cluster based on their characteristics, this project brings Spotify data to life through clear and interactive visualizations.
